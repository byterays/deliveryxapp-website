                    <p class="lead">Air freight in India plays a pivotal role in the country's logistics and trade
                        ecosystem, providing swift and efficient transportation of goods. With the rapid growth of the
                        Indian economy and international trade, the demand for air freight services has seen a
                        significant upsurge. Major airports across the country, such as Indira Gandhi International
                        Airport in Delhi, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in Mumbai, and Kempegowda
                        International Airport in Bangalore, serve as crucial hubs for air cargo operations. The sector
                        has witnessed advancements in technology and infrastructure, contributing to improved handling
                        and tracking systems. Despite facing challenges such as airspace congestion and regulatory
                        complexities, the air freight industry in India continues to evolve, fostering global
                        connectivity and facilitating the timely movement of goods across borders.</p>

                    <p>Air freight, or air cargo allows the transport of goods quickly by air. Shipping cargo by air has
                        always been a high cost-to-weight form of shipment, countered by the fact that itâ€™s the fastest
                        way to transport goods nationally and internationally.</p>
