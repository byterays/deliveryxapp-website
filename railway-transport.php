                        Railway transport in India is a cornerstone of the country's transportation network,
                        playing a vital role in the movement of passengers and freight. Indian Railways, one of
                        the largest railway networks in the world, spans the vast expanse of the nation,
                        connecting remote villages to bustling cities. </p>

                    <p>The rail system serves as a
                        cost-effective and energy-efficient mode of transport, contributing significantly to the
                        country's economic development. Iconic trains such as the Rajdhani Express and Shatabdi
                        Express exemplify the speed and connectivity offered by the railway network. Freight
                        transport by rail is crucial for the movement of goods, with dedicated freight corridors
                        being developed to enhance efficiency. Despite facing challenges such as infrastructure
                        maintenance and modernization, railway transport remains an integral part of India's
                        transportation landscape, catering to the diverse needs of its population and economy.
                    </p>
