                    <p class="lead">Road transport in India is the backbone of the country's extensive and
                        diverse transportation system. The vast network of roads, spanning from national
                        highways to rural lanes, facilitates the movement of people and goods across the nation.
                        With a burgeoning population and increasing economic activities, road transport plays a
                        crucial role in connecting urban and rural areas, contributing significantly to India's
                        socioeconomic development. </p>

                    <p>The road infrastructure has witnessed continuous
                        improvements, with ongoing efforts to upgrade and expand highways for smoother
                        connectivity. Trucks, buses, and various modes of private transportation dominate the
                        roadways, providing accessibility to even the most remote regions. Despite challenges
                        such as traffic congestion and road maintenance, road transport remains a vital
                        component of India's transportation landscape, fostering mobility, trade, and economic
                        growth.</p>
